## Why Should we care?

__A botnet takeover storytelling__ :

* The Botnet Threat
	A network of compromised machines (bots) controlled by a bot master
	Responsible for(non-exhausitve list):
		* Large-scale network probing (i.e., scanning activities)
		* Launching Distributed Denial of Service(DDos) attacks
		* Sending large-scale unsolicited emails (SPAM)
		* Click-fraud campaign
		* Information theft
	Shift from a for-fun activity to for profit

		* Distributed via the Mebroot "malware platform"
		* Injects itself into 29 different applications.
		* Steals sensitive information
		* HTTP injection for phishing
		* Uses "encrypted" HTTP as Command & Control (C&C) protocol.
		* Uses a resilient approach (domain flux) to contact a C&C server.
	* Mebroot
		* Spreads via Drive-by Downloads

## Data Collection Priciples

__Principle 1__: the hijacked botnet should be operated so tha any harm and/or damage to victims and targets of attacks would be minimized
	* Always responded with okn message
	* Never sent new/blank configuration file

__Principle 2__ :the sinkholed botnet should collect enough information to enable notification and remediation of affected parties.
	* Worked with law enforceent (FBI and DoD Cybercrime Units)
	* Worked with bank security officers
	* Worked with ISPs
