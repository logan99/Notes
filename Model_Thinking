## Section 1: 

#### Section 1: Introduction: Why Model?

In these lectures, I describe some of the reasons why a person would want to take a modeling course. These reasons fall into four broad categories:

To be an intelligent citizen of the world
To be a clearer thinker
To understand and use data
To better decide, strategize, and design
There are two readings for this section. These should be read either after the first video or at the completion of all of the videos.

__Readings__ : 

The Model Thinker: Prologue, Introduction and Chapter 1

Why Model? by Joshua Epstein


Why Model?

* Reason #1 : Intelligent Citizen of the World.
* Reason #2 : Clearer Thinker.
* Reason #3 : Understand and Use Data.
* Reason #4 : Decide, Strategize, and Design.

#### Section Structure

* The model
	- Assumptions, results, applications

* Technical Details
	- Measures, Proofs (Easy, Medium, Hard)
	- Practice Problems

* Fertility


__Intelligent Citizen of the World__ :

They are simply abstraction or simplification that's why they are wrong. 
"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful" -- *George E.P.Box*

Models are the New Lingua Franca, the language of academics, politics, and all the fields.

Models gives us conditions to connective the different elements of the information under study.

Models tie us to mass to the logic. In this case, mass is data.

Models are used by Economics, Biology, Sociology, Political Science:Voting, Linguistics, Law, GameTheory.

Models Are Better than we are. They give better represenation of the world around us, then we really perceive it.

__Models are Fertile__ : They can be implemented in different field.

__Models make us Humble__ : What we think, and what we are going to happen is different.

Know more models to be smart than others.Formal Models do better then others.
Know more formal methods sire!

__Models make us Clear Thinker__ :

1. First thing we do, name the parts of the model.
2. Build Relationship between the parts.
3. Understand class of Outcome (What really happens in the Model).
4. Identify logical Boundaries.
5. Communticate to the outer world.

Ex. We want to study how people choose to go to restuarants.

	1. The people, restaurant, the time they have, the money they have, how expensive is the restaurant , how far is the restaurant from their current location.
	2. Then find a logical relationship between them.
	3. Draw prefences. 
	4. Conclude on the model created.

Another Example :

	1. We want to drop the earth through a spiral ring. For that, we have to make sure that there is enough space for earth to go through the ring. Let's make a 1 diameter space for the earth to slip by.

	Circumference of the Cirlce = pie * Diameter
	Circumference of the Earth = pie * Diameter(E)
	Circumference of the Ring = pie * Diamter (E +2 )
							  = pie * Diamter + pie * 2
							  = 25,000 + 6.98 meter.


One can go for inductive exploring, i.e., you can try the induction and how it works to create a model. For example, there is a shop and people generally overcrowd at the entrance/exit. To make it more uncrowded, we put the bar in front of the door. So people now bump at the door and then go around it. This might solve the problem and hence we inducitively explore before we conclude the model and it's working capacity.

Understanding the class of outcomes is one aspect of modelling. It can be any of the following:

1. Equilibrium -- Referes to an equilibrium state inside the model like the earth atomosphere
2. Cycle -- The rainfall model
3. Random -- The radiactive emmissions.
4. Complex.	-- The DNA structure.


Indentifying Logical Boundaries like where it will not work , and when it works is an imporant part of modelling.

We communicate with the help of the model. Like in political Systems.


## Use and Understand Data

1. Undertand Patterns. e.g., straight line, increasing straight line etc.
2. Predict Points. e.g., we want to predict something, like the price of the housing through linear model.
3. Produce Bounds.
4. Retrodict -- How good the model is.
5. Predict Other --- that is not clear but can be predicted.
6. Inform Data Collection.
	-- Teacher Quality
	-- Parential Status
	-- Income
	-- Class Status
	-- Technology
	-- Health
	-- Students
7. Estimate Hidden parameters.
8. Calibrate -- Constructing Model by calibrating.


# Decide, Strategize and Design.

1. Desicion Aids i.e., Financial Decision, Monty Hall Problem.
2. Comparative Statics.
3. Counterfactuals.
4. Identify and Rank Levels. ex., country failures,Climate change -- Carbon Model.
5. Experimental Design.
6. Institutional Design.
7. Help choose among Policies and Institutions.

How can help models?

1. Real Time Decision Aids
2. Comparative Statics
3. Counterfactuals
4. Identify and Rank Levers.
5. Experimental Design.
6. Institutional Design.
7. Help choose among policies and Institutions.

# Section 2


Emperical Phenomenon. 
Groups of people who hang out together, they look alike, think alike and do things alike.


Detrioit -- A place where causcian are majority.We generally try to be something around us.

Sorting vs Peer Effects.

Sorting -- Homophoily. We go around with same thinking people.

Peer Effect -- we think like our peers.


__Famous Model__ we will study:

1. Schelling Model.
2. Granovetter Model.
3. Standing Ovation Model.
4. Identification Model.

Type of Model we are going to use in this section are Agent based Models.

*Agents* can be Individuals.Agents have *behaviorus*,rule they follow. Then this become game theory model, optimzing model. Once agents get added with rules gives birth of *outcomes*.

So Agent based model have 3 components:

1. People
2. Behaviorus
3. Outcomes. (people + Behaviour)


#### Schelling's Segregation Model

Schelling is trying to understand the emperical phenomenon. Emperical Phenomenon he is interested in segregation. Two types of segregation , he was interested in

* Racial Segregation.
* Segregation by Income.

Red dot represent causician and so on...there is map described racial segregation.
Again same thing done with Segregation by Income. It's very stark.


People may be racist and we can confirm this with the help of a model.

Schelling's model takes a look at where people want to live. 

Micromotives not equal Macrobehaviour. People are resilient to the idea of racisim and they only want may be like 3/7 of their neighbours to be alike. But on macro level, this is not the case, people are segregated by race and on large proportions.  That why it is said that micromotives =/ macromotives.

Tipping phenomenon in Shelling Model. If one moves, other have to move , this is __exodus tip__. 

__Genesis Tip__ :- Someone moves in, makes some out.

#### Measuring Segregation

__Measures of Disimilarities__ : 

We will going to measure with the help of index of disimilarities.

We take *Rich* as Blue and *Poor* as Yellow.

Place these people in a grid with 24 blocks with 10 people per block

__Case 1__
In 12 blocks all Rich
In 6 blokcs all poor
In 6 blocks half rich/half poor

Rich People = 150
Poor people = 90
Total People = 240

b = # blue in block
B =# blue total(150)
y = #yellow in block
Y = #yellow total (90)

|b/B - y/Y| = index of disimilariteis

For example 5B and 3Y

|5/150 - 3/90| = |1/30 - 1/30| = 0 .... No segregation

In case of 1st case

For each Rich blue block |10/150 - 0/90| = 1/15
For each yellow poor block |0/150 - 10/90| = 1/9
for mixed block |5/150 - 5/90| = 1/45

Thus

6 x 1/45 + 6 x 1/9 + 12 x 1/15 = 72/45

Lets do some extereme cases

Case 2
8 blocks of half rich/half poor

Each block contains 5 blue and 5 yellow

80 total, 40 rich and 40 poor

Index of dissimilarities |5/40| - |5/40| = 0

Case 3

8 blocks,4 blocks of rich, 4 blocks of poor

|0/40 - 10/40| = 1/4

1/4 x 8 = 2

To normalize we divide by 2 , so 2/2 =1

So , if we have no segregation we get a score of 0 and full segregation will get a score of 1

Thus, for the first case, we get 72/90 = 0.8 

Therefore, index of disimilarites = 0.8

For philidalphia = 0.8 
For detroit = 0.6 [less segregated then what it looks like, vision is delusion]

 
#### Peer Effects

Granovettor's Model

 -- N individuals
 -- Each has a Threshold
	- T(j) for person j
	- join if T(j) others join.

This model somewhat explains why we are not able to predict revolutions like the egypt revolution, ukranian revolution. The idea is simple, there is a threshold for every person who joins the cause. So, if the group threshold increases, this might meet the criteria of other person's threshold, which in turn will make them join the cause.

For example.

We have 5 persons who are likely to buy a orange cap.

the Threshold are as below

Person 1 -> 0 (i.e. he will buy the orange cap, even if noone bothers to have one)
Person 2 -> 1 (i.e he will buy the orange cap, if one of this peers has a orange cap)
Person 3 -> 2 (self explanatory from above statements)
Person 4 -> 2
Person 5 -> 2


Another example 

Person 1 -> 1				Person 1 -> 1
Person 2 -> 2				Person 2 -> 2
Person 3 -> 3				Person 3 -> 3
Person 4 -> 3				Person 4 -> 4
Person 5 -> 2				Person 5 -> 5
					Person 6 -> 0

Average - 11/5 =2.2			Average - 15/6 = 3

Even the 2nd model have high values of threshold for each person, it will succeded as it has a seed to start with, in comparision with the first model which will not even start as no one will be willing to buy the cap.


#### The Standing Ovation Model

This model builds upon the Granovettor's model. 

Do I stand up? Do I follow others? This is all about in this model. as people follow rules. As people follow rules and aggregate.

This is a model of peer effect. As other people stand, you stand. 
Another thing is information. For example if one person knows a lot about theathre and after the show, she stands and claps viciously , so you think the show is good and you start to clap too..

-- Threshold to stand : T ( more individual property compared to grenavettor model)
-- Quality: Q (T compares to Q)
-- Signal : S = Q + E
-- Initial Rule
     - if S>T , Stand
-- Subsequent Rule
     - Stand if more X % stand

The rule stands on 2 things, the T and X

Claim 1: Higher Q, more people stand.

Stand if Q+error > T

Claim 2: Lower T, more people stand.

Stand if Q+error > T

Claim 3 : Lower X. More onvations.

Stand if more than x %

Now, Big X? Small X?

Big X = secure people 
Small X= people who wants to jump of bandwagon.

Signal : S= Q + E

E = Error |
E = Diveristy

Case 1 :

1000 people
T = 60
Q = 50 

50 < 60 , people are not going to stand.

E in [-15,+15]

35 <---> 50 <---> 65

so some stand , and major sit.

Case 2:

Variation is [-50,50]

0 <--> 50 <--> 60 <--> 100

40 % of people will stand up.

So large diveristy or large error you are more likely to stand up.

Claim 4: if Q <T , more variation in E, more people will stand.

Stand if Q+E > T

Audience -- Diverse, Unsophisticated.
Performance -- Multidimensional, Complex.

What we did learn?

1. Higher Quality, standing ovation.
2. Lower Threshold, standing ovation
3. Larger Peer Effects , standing ovation
4. More variation , standing ovation.

##### Ovations Advanced

Modelling needs to make things out. -- People miss the theatre and couples.

The cone effect -- The rectangular theatre sitting, has a cone effect on any random person. The person on the first row, will have no cone what so ever, so they are like celebirty as they are seen by almost all the people from the back. But, with the same logic the last row of people can be termed as academic, as they judge everyone but no one gives them value.

The date effect -- 
 If you are with date, it's more likely for you to stand up if your date stands up.

5. Use Celebrities.
6. Big Groups.

__Fertility__ 

 * Collective Action.
 * Academic Performance.
 * Urban Renewal.
 * Fitness/Health.
 * Online Course.
 * Facebook popularity Model.


#### The Identification Problem

How do we know is this the effect of Schelling or Standing Ovation. is this because of homophily or peer effect?

Schelling :- Phildelphia Segregation, school model
Standing Ovation: - Generic names for soft drinks in USA.

The big sort talks about sorting.
Connected talks about peer effects.


We have A's and B's

Two population:- 

AABBAA

BBABBA

If sorting happens , the A from 2nd population to 1st population and vice-versa. (People move)
If peer-effects happens, two B's in 1st population become A and similarily in 2nd population.(Identification Change)

Need Dynamic data for Identification. Hence model are useful for data collection, as it helps to identify the data to be collected.


#### Section 3- Aggregation

Basic mathematics , add them up and sum of the whole of the parts. Aggregation is tricky in case of social real world. 

__More is Different__ : Is a book by Aneston. Take a riductionist apporach, but at the end , we get something different when we add them up. As the whole, the world is different.

Ex. Single water molecule (H20). One molecule water cannot be wet. So wettness is a property of a bunch of water molecules. 

Ex2. Like congnition, millions of neurons.

**Aggregation of**

1. Actions.
2. Single Rule (game of life).
3. Family of Rules.
4. Preferences. (Example from social science.)
