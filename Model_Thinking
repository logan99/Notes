__Course Name__ : Model Thinking

_Reasons to study the course_ : Need for Research and project work

## Section 1: 

#### Section 1: Introduction: Why Model?

In these lectures, I describe some of the reasons why a person would want to take a modeling course. These reasons fall into four broad categories:

To be an intelligent citizen of the world
To be a clearer thinker
To understand and use data
To better decide, strategize, and design
There are two readings for this section. These should be read either after the first video or at the completion of all of the videos.

__Readings__ : 

The Model Thinker: Prologue, Introduction and Chapter 1

Why Model? by Joshua Epstein


Why Model?

* Reason #1 : Intelligent Citizen of the World.
* Reason #2 : Clearer Thinker.
* Reason #3 : Understand and Use Data.
* Reason #4 : Decide, Strategize, and Design.

#### Section Structure

* The model
	- Assumptions, results, applications

* Technical Details
	- Measures, Proofs (Easy, Medium, Hard)
	- Practice Problems
* Fertility


__Intelligent Citizen of the World__ :

They are simply abstraction or simplification that's why they are wrong. 
"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful" -- *George E.P.Box*

Models are the New Lingua Franca, the language of academics, politics, and all the fields.

Models gives us conditions to connective the different elements of the information under study.

Models tie us to mass to the logic. In this case, mass is data.

Models are used by Economics, Biology, Sociology, Political Science:Voting, Linguistics, Law, GameTheory.

Models Are Better than we are. They give better represenation of the world around us, then we really perceive it.

__Models are Fertile__ : They can be implemented in different field.

__Models make us Humble__ : What we think, and what we are going to happen is different.

Know more models to be smart than others.Formal Models do better then others.
Know more formal methods sire!

__Models make us Clear Thinker__ :

1. First thing we do, name the parts of the model.
2. Build Relationship between the parts.
3. Understand class of Outcome (What really happens in the Model).
4. Identify logical Boundaries.
5. Communticate to the outer world.

Ex. We want to study how people choose to go to restuarants.

	1. The people, restaurant, the time they have, the money they have, how expensive is the restaurant , how far is the restaurant from their current location.
	2. Then find a logical relationship between them.
	3. Draw prefences. 
	4. Conclude on the model created.

Another Example :

	1. We want to drop the earth through a spiral ring. For that, we have to make sure that there is enough space to go through the ring. Let's make a 1 diameter space for the earth to slip by.

	Circumference of the Cirlce = pie * Diameter
	Circumference of the Earth = pie * Diameter(E)
	Circumference of the Ring = pie * Diamter (E +2 )
							  = pie * Diamter + pie * 2
							  = 25,000 + 6.98 meter.


One can go for inductive exploring, i.e., you can try the induction and how it works to create a model. For example, there is a shop and people generally overcrowd at the entrance/exit. To make it more uncrowded, we put the bar in front of the door. So people now bump at the door and then go around it. This might solve the problem and hence we inducitively explore before we conclude the model and it's working capacity.

Understanding the class of outcomes is one aspect of modelling. It can be any of the following:

1. Equilibrium -- Referes to an equilibrium state inside the model like the earth atomosphere
2. Cycle -- The rainfall model
3. Random -- The radiactive emmissions.
4. Complex.	-- The DNA structure.


Indentifying Logical Boundaries like where it will not work , and when it works is an imporant part of modelling.

We communicate with the help of the model. Like in political Systems.


## Use and Understand Data

1. Undertand Patterns. e.g., straight line, increaing straight line etc.
2. Predict Points. e.g., we want to predict something, like the price of the housing through linear model.
3. Produce Bounds.
4. Retrodict -- How good the model is.
5. Predict Other --- that is not clear but can be predicted.
6. Infrom Data Collection.
	-- Teacher Quality
	-- Parential Status
	-- Income
	-- Class Status
	-- Technology
	-- Healths.
	-- Students.
7. Estimate Hidden parameters.
8. Calibrate -- Constructing Model by calibrating.


# Decide, Strategize and Design.

1. Desicion Aids i.e., Financial Decision, Monty Hall Problem.
2. Comparative Statics.
3. Counterfactuals.
4. Identify and Rank Levels. ex., country failures,Climate change -- Carbon Model.
5. Experimental Design.
6. Institutional Design.
7. Help choose among Policies and Institutions.

How can help models?

1. Real Time Decision Aids
2. Comparative Statics
3. Counterfactuals
4. Identify and Rank Levers.
5. Experimental Design.
6. Institutional Design.
7. Help choose among policies and Institutions.

# Section 2


Emperical Phenomenon. 
Groups of people who hang out together, they look alike, think alike and do things alike.


Detrioit -- A place where causcian are majority.We generally try to be something around us.

Sorting vs Peer Effects.

Sorting -- Homophoily. We go around with same thinking people.

Peer Effect -- we think like our peers.


__Famous Model__ we will study:

1. Schelling Model.
2. Granovetter Model.
3. Standing Ovation Model.
4. Identification Model.

Type of Model we are going to use in this section are Agent based Models.

*Agents* can be Individuals.Agents have *behaviorus*,rule they follow. Then this become game theory model, optimzing model. Once agents get added with rules gives birth of *outcomes*.

So Agent based model have 3 components:

1. People
2. Behaviorus
3. Outcomes. (people + Behaviour)


#### Schelling's Segregation Model

Schelling is trying to understand the emperical phenomenon. Emperical Phenomenon he is interested in segregation. Two types of segregation , he was interested in

* Racial Segregation.
* Segregation by Income.

Red dot represent causician and so on...there is map described racial segregation.
Again same thing doen with Segregation by Income. It's very stark.


People may be racist and we can confirm this with the help of a model.

Schelling's model takes a look at where people want to live. 

Micromotives not equal Macrobehaviour

Tipping phenomenon in Shelling Model. If one moves, other have to move , this is exodus tip. 

Genesis Tip :- Someone moves in, makes some out.
