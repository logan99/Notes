## Goals for Reading

* read actively
* identify arguements
* weight evidence
* evaluate sources
* question assumptions
* identify biased information

## Critique vs. Criticize

* __Criticize__: To find fault with, to judge unfavourably or harshly
* __Critique__: To review or analyze. (also a noun: *"a critique of..."*)

## Four step Apporach to reading and Writing Criticially

### First Reading :Previewing
* skim a text quickly for the main ideas
* Pay attention to the introduction
* Read the opening sentences of paragraphs, and section headings.


## Annotate and Analyze

* Read more slowly this time, and take notes
* Annotate - write notes, and most importantly, questions
* Find the evidence and analyze/evaluate it

## Review

* Read a thrid time
* Read your questions and notes
* Look for unfamiliar words
* Make sure you understand any confusing or complicated parts of the reading

## Respond in Writing

* Freewrite
* Summarize
* Outline
* Connect to other texts
* Write a formal critique

This is the my first markdown documents. Markdown is awesome.

## SelfEvaluate 

* Think about what you've learned
* Write more questions
* Write what you still want to know
* Do some research

This is a __fasinating__ read for my brains. It's great to know that as we grow old we just get __wiser__ and not slower. This simple study demostrated by _Dr. Michael Ramscar of TÃ¼bingen University_ questions/critique the methods linquistics and scientist use to measure cognitive capabilities. T

According to the research, the older brain gets slower only because of it's increased capacity to store items. They compared it to the computer with limited memory that of a human and co-related to find that Older people only grow slower but that doesn't demostrate the slowness of brain but the assertiveness they carry around them. In short, they have more memory or data to process. 

The argument is very simplistic and plausible. Crytallized memory do help, and that can even make older people make better decision and solve puzzles that need experience and not raw power. 

Younger brains always enjoy their raw power and churn out more output than that of the Older brains. The tests also confirm that due to change in generations and more information available older brains may not be adept to the new way of living. 

Ramscar and his collegues' work privdes more than an explanation of why, in the light of all the extra information they have to process, we might expect odler brains to seem slower and more forgetful than younger brains.Their work also shows how changes in test performance that have beend taken as evidence for declining coginitive abilites in fact demostrates older adults' greater mastery of the knowledge they have acquired. Dr.Ramscar's research was based on Computer models of vocabulary learning.

Paired-associate learning , a commonly used cognitive test that involves learning by association of words in memory. They argued that older brains because of much better knowledge of the grammer and meaning of vocabulary find it difficult to make associations compared to younger brains.

Even __Prof. Harald Baayen__ , who heads the Alexander von Humboldt Quantitative Linguistis research group  where the work was carried out puts it, "If you think linguistic skill involves something like being able to choose one world given another, younger adults seem to do better in this task. But, of course, proper understanding of language involves more than this. You have also to not put plausible but wrong pairs of words together. The fact that older adults find nonsense pairs -- but not connected pairs -- harder to learn than young adults simply demonstrates older adults' much better understanding of language. They have to make more of an effort to learn unrelated word pairs because, unlike the youngsters, they know a lot about which words don't belong together."

The conclusion was not final and they concluded that we need better tests for the cognitive abiliteis of older people, speed alone should not determine the sharpness of such a complex brain humans possess.

"The brains of older people do no get weak," says Michael Ramscar.
"On the contrary, they simply know more".


# Specialized Vocabulary learning

Methods to __Improve__ Specialized Vocabulary

-- Every Field has Specialized Vocabulary Learning.

## Find Written Materials

* Indentify the field you want to learn vocabulary in
* Look for blogs, websites, and glossaries
* Facebook or likedin can help
* Look for context of the words

## Find Spoken Materials

* Hear them pronounced correctly
* Hear them in context
* Find Podcasts(iTunes, for example)
* Look for instructional videos on TED, yourube, or Vimeo
* Watch University lectures

## Organize Your Learning

* Keep a journal or notebook
* Organize words into fields, categories
* Learn vocabulary in groups, not individually
* Learn vocabulary context

Review often and use the terms when ever I can.
