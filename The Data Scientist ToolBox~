__Type of Data Science Questions__ :

In approximate order of difficulty

* Descriptive
* Exploratory
* Inferential
* Predictive
* Causal
* Mechanistic

## About Descriptive Analyses

Goal: Describe a set of data

1. The first kind of data analysis performed.
2. Commonly applied to census data
3. The description and interpretation are different steps.
4. Descriptions can usually not be generalized without additional statistical modeling

Ex. Google Ngram

## About Exploratory Analsis

Goal: Find relationships you didn't know about

1. Exploratory models are good for discovering new connections.
2. They are also useful for defining future studies.
3. Exploratory analyses are usually not the final say.
4. Exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing/predicting.
5. ##Correlation does not imply causation##.

## About Inferential analysis

Goal: Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population.

1. Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models.
2. Inference involves estimating both the quantity you care about and your uncertainty about your estimate.
3. Inference depends heavily on both the population and the sampling scheme.

## About predictive analysis

Goal: To use the data on some objects to predict values for another object.

1. If X predicts Y it does not mean X causes Y.
2. Accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables.
3. Although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and a sample model works really well.
4. Prediction is very hard, especially about the future references.


## About causal analysis

Goal: To find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change.

1. Usually randomized studies are required to identify causation.
2. There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions.
3. Causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual.
4. Causal models are usually the "gold standard" for data analysis.

## About Mechanistic analysis

Goal: Understand the exact changes in variables that elad to changes in other variabels for individual objects.

1. Incredibly hard to infer, expect in simple situations.
2. Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations(physical/engineering science.)
3. Generally the random component of the data is measurement error.
4. If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis.

# What is data?

__Definition:__ "Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items."

**Set of items** : Sometimes call the population; the set of objects you are interested in.

Variables :A measurement or characteristic of an item.

The data is the second most important thing

1. The most important thing in data science is the question.
2. The second most important is the data.
3. Often the data will limit or enable the questions.
4. But having data can't save you if you don't have a question.
