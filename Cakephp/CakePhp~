__CakePHP__: Kevinbanners
__Date__: 20/06/14

Cakephp uses a MVC architecure and OOPS concept. It utilizes the concept of DRY implementation. The main logic of the application goes into MODEL of the specific object. It is directly connected with the database.

The views are the frontpage of the website. Views interact with the users and the mediator between the Views and Model is Controller. The controller is called the middle-pie or the nervours system of cakephp.

First we need to define the model of the object we need to define. We do it it singluar form. The plural form is used in the database for storage purposes. Cakephp goes well with most of the databases. In this case we will use mysql. 

For example if the model name is Freind then the name of the table used in the databse is Friends.

#### Work
__Time__: 12:03 
__Working on__ : Update fix- currently all post are being placed and displayed numerically. We need the post to be displayed from newest to oldest. when a new post is posted the prior post gets bumped down.


Done with this on my banners. need to change the order in other mybanner functions.
$data_sorted = $this->Banner->find('all',array('order'=>array("Banner.created DESC")));	

Changed it in two functions, one in my_banners and other in the admin_index

=======================================================================================================
__Time__ : 1:00
__Working on__ : we would like the capability to create accounts manually  in the back admin section where it says customers. with out the need of a email verification (by pass). all we need is Name, email, and password to create the account. This method is so we can invite new advertisers to our site with a free account already made for convenience. All they would have to do is log in with the credentials provided and they can later update and save their info such as password and name.

Done with the customer login pages in admin. __There is a small bug that don't let the created user log in.__. __The bug is related to hosting it on real server. As the account being created need to be verified.__. __Time__: Added a verify box, which takes value as one
__Update1__ : Done with the job, added a verified readonly box and circumvents the verification of the customer.

					$fileArr2 	 = $this->data['Banner']['image1'];
					$fileArr3 	 = $this->data['Banner']['image2'];
					
					$randNumImg1 = time() + rand(0,1000);
					$randNumImg2 = time() + rand(0,1000);

__Time__: 4:00 24 Tues 2014
__Working on__:  Update fix- general tab categories should be connected to all categories in related in city's. Meaning general catagorie show all the ads listed in that state.
__Idea__ : Reterive all the data from the database where country == 'california' and state='all'
Country ID and (select * from states)


================================================================================================
__Time__: 5:53 24 June Tues 2014
__Working on__: 1. Ad Blue banner highlight-
 
we want to make this premium ads placement to earning income from the site faster. So user have the option to highlight their ad being placed with a blue highlight banner to be recognized by shoppers and to be distinguished by other advertisers. This feature is 99 cents and none refundable (which they must agree to) and we would like for it to be linked to paypal or google wallet for now. once payments is received to paypal they should automatically have the highlight  on their ad placement. These ads need to expire in 14 days instead of 5
 
With this feature we will need a premium ads catagorie in the admin to better maintain these specific ads and to cater to them if needed. We gota see all of them, and we have to be able to even renew them manually if necessary, we gota be able to have full control on the premium ads in the admin.  FYI- once the ad expires users will no longer have it as premium ads

__Idea__: 
1. Change the upload form. Create a option for premium ads. If ads are selected redirect or load the same page with paypal or google wallet. Once paid the customer is redirected to my_banners view. __NEED AJAX__
2. Create a field name is_premium (binary). If selected as binary value 1, the add is premium otherwise non-premium.

__Problem__: How to highlight the banner if premium? change the view with premium check. __in banners view__ 
__Soltion__: Fetch the is_premium value and if it is true, render differently otherwise render the way it was. Use foreach loop to go through all the banners returned by the database according to the condition.

__Problem__: Expire the premium ads in 14 days. 
__Solution__:Update the view function in banner controller to check if 14 days has expired or not. If yes, change the is_premium to 0. This will reflect the view and then load the banner as normal banner. 

==================================================================================================

__Time:__ : 6:05 PM 24 June 2014
__Working on__: Fix Update- ad expires in 5 days automatically. Users will have to renew their ads within their my banners account to make it live again and bump it back to the top of the daily deals list. Make the ad have a red dark green banner color to show it has expired.

__Idea__ : For non-premium ads with is_premium filed with 0, update the view controller to check for 5 days. If expires change the status field in banners to 0. 
After expiry user have to change to active in their my_banners.

==================================================================================================

__Problem__: banner not loading when slecting template. 
__Fixed__: By adding ['Banner']['image1'] == null;
		and  ['Banner']['image2] == null;


__Date__ : 4:00 PM 30th June 2014
__Problem__: Implemented the plugin and inserted paypal tables into the database.


__Date__: 6:00 PM 30th June 2014
__Problem__:2. Fix Update- ad expires in 5 days automatically. Users will have to renew their ads within their my banners account to make it live again and bump it back to the top of the daily deals list. Make the ad have a red dark green banner color to show it has expired.
__Solution__:Formulated the algorithm to solve the problem. Need to turn it into code. And need to decide where to put the code inside the MVC Architecture.
__Algorithm__: Pick the value of the created column of each entity, use strtotime function and pass the datetime format. It will be converted to seconds. Calulate the time elapsed by substracting the current datetime. Check if it is less than 5 days. If yes, do not render the banner. Do the changes in view.

 public function checktime_normal($id = 0){
		$data = $this->Banner->find('all')
		$value = false;
		$time = strtotime($this->$data['Banner']['created']);
		if ($this->data['banner']['is_premium'] == 0) {
			if ($time - time() < 5*24*60*60) {
				$value = true;
			}
		} else {
			if ($time - time() < 14*24*60*60) {
				$value = true;
			}
		}
	}

__Changes in view if premium check__
	if (time() - $Banner['Banner']['created'] < 14*24*60*60)
__Changes in view if non_premium check__
	if (time() - $Banner['Banner]['created] < 5*24*60*60)


__Date__: 6:15 PM 30th June 2014
__Problem__: Premium ads should be checked for 14 days expirations in the same way as the earlier problem.


__Date__: 6:40 PM 30th June 2014
__Problem__: 7. Update fix- ad is is pending review. When users place a new ad the way it is set up now it is to be approved by admin team. what we need is Users need to see that their ads is pending review on the banner preferable directly under the banner image. And when approve it should show it is (approved), and when suspended it should show (suspended), when in review until approve it should show (Pending review) all in blue
__Solution__: Add pending_review to banner table. Only admin can change the variable value. 
For this to work all pending banners should be shown in admin panel with option to make it live by one click or edit and change the value manually.


__Time elapsed__ : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2915864/php-how-to-find-the-time-elapsed-since-a-date-time


__Date__: 6:45 PM 30th June 2014
__Problem__: 6. Update fix- general tab categories should be connected to all categories in related in city's. Meaning general catagorie show all the ads listed in that state
__Solution__: Need to learn SQL and create complex queries. Think about the problem to solve it clearly.

__Date__: 6:50 PM 30th June 2014
__Problem__: 3. FIx update- In the admin panel we need a daily deals section to view ads, control the ads placement. Meaning make a certain ad static at the top all the time, push a ad down, And even see the general daily deals feed section (None zipcode)
__Solution__: learn background creation in cakephp



/**

* and change the status to 0 , in case of non-premium
* 
* @return void

How to update the time stamp in cakephp

$this->data['SomeModel']['your_datetime_field'] = DboSource::expression('NOW()');
$this->Model->save($this->data);



<?php if (time() - strtotime($Banner['Banner']['created']) > 5*24*60*60)  { ?>
					<td>Premium Status:</td>
					<td>
					<?php $this->Form->create('Banner') ?>
					<?php

					$options1 = array(
						'label' => 'Update Banner',
						'class' => 'curve2 button1',
					);?>
					<?php echo $this->Form->end($options1); ?>





//form creation for the mybanner.ctp


<?php if (time() - strtotime($Banner['Banner']['created']) > 5*24*60*60) { ?>

__Fix__: 1. In admin panel, when editing, the is_premium part is setting defaulting to premium. --> Fixed
	2. After editing the premium part , it should redirect to the review premium part. --> half fixed, __need to fix the redirect one.__

	3. Fix the timestamp to latest one , when the user activate it from the edit option in mybanner. --> __Solved by creating a "modified" column in the banner__


__fixed__ : the flag the banner in the home index file.

============================================================================================================================
__DATE__: 7 July 2014

__Banner Database Field Details__ :

1. __status__ : 0 => non-active
		1 => active

2. __pause__: 0 => not-suspended
	      1 => suspended.


if ($banners['banner']['status'] == 0) {<li><span class="fl">Pending Review</span></li></div>}
else if ($banners['banner']['status'] == 1 ) {<li><span class="fl"> Approved</span> </li>}
else if ($banners['banner']['pause'] == 1) {<li><span class="fl">Suspended</span> </li>}


__Suspending left__ Need to ask what pause do.


__bug to fix__ : premium and non-premium expiry is not working. __NOW WORKING__


==============

__Working on__ : 4. Update fix- daily deals stream to match with zip code area location. This can work if users have to put in a zip code of there location during ad placement. Use zip code data to execute this

__Solution__: 
0. Modify the update customer, to update the billing zip,  and available states. 
1. Reterive state related to the zipcode if present otherwise render the default daily deals. First search for the record with the zipcode for all the users.
2. Then loop through the reterived data and show it in the daily deals.


===============
__Working on__: 3. Fix update- In the admin panel we need a daily deals section to view ads, control the ads placement. Meaning make a certain ad static at the top all the time, push an ad down, And even see the general daily deals feed section (None zipcode)

__Solution__: 
0. Add the daily deals section to view ads (Very easy).
1. Control the ads placement.(???) , functionalities like making an add static at top(fixed), push an ad down
to make add static, add a field to banner known as static and non-static. Render the static first. Similarily, non-static will be rendered next.
  	__Implementing down or up banner__ : use sorting and swap to implement this. 
2. add the general deal deals feed section(with none zipcode) (Easy).

================

__Working on__ : 6. Update fix- general tab categories should be connected to all categories in related in city's. Meaning general catagorie show all the ads listed in that state
 

__Solution__: when clicked General,  use states table to select the records that have the same country name and different state, show them in daily deals section.




__Date__: 9/July/2014

__Working on__ : Sorting according to first premium, then giving preference to modified time and then to id

// );
		$this->paginate = array(
		    'limit' => 10,
		    'order' => array('is_premium'=>'DESC','modified'=> 'DESC','id' => 'DESC'),
		     );
		$data = $this->paginate('Banner', $condition);


__Fix__ : Fix the filter in new admin sections "Daily Deals Section" and "Pending Review" and "Premium".



__Date__ : 10 July 2014
__Working on__ :4. Update fix- daily deals stream to match with zip code area location. This can work if users have to put in a zip code of there location during ad placement. Use zip code data to execute this

__Idea__: when banners data is fetched it fetches it with the customer table as well, because of the data model. 
We fetch the customer zipcode and use $this->Banner->find('first', array (conditions);
In view, check for user authenticatin , is any user is logged in then display the filtered zipcode data, otherwise show all the daily deals.

__Implementation__ : tommorrow.


__Idea to implement the up and down banner functionality__ : declare an empty array. fetch all the daily deals banner with status == 1. now when you push up or down, it just rearranges the array accordingly. If done properly, it will be done. __Note__:
