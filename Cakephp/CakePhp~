__CakePHP__: Kevinbanners
__Date__: 20/06/14

Cakephp uses a MVC architecure and OOPS concept. It utilizes the concept of DRY implementation. The main logic of the application goes into MODEL of the specific object. It is directly connected with the database.

The views are the frontpage of the website. Views interact with the users and the mediater between the Views and Model is Controller. The controller is called the middle-pie or the nervours system of cakephp.

First we need to define the model of the object we need to define. We do it it singluar form. The plural form is used in the database for storage purposes. Cakephp goes well with most of the databases. In this case we will use mysql. 

For example if the model name is Friend then the name of the table used in the databse is Friends.

__Working on__ : we would like the capability to create accounts manually  in the back admin section where it says customers. with out the need of a email verification (by pass). all we need is Name, email, and password to create the account.

All they would have to do is log in with the credentials provided and they can later update and save their info such as password and name.
